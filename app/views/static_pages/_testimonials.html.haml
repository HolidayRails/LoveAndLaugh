    Love and Laughter Daycare has been a part of our extended family for the last 5 years. When I needed to look for a daycare option for my older child, I visited several daycares but none of them compared to this particular daycare. I knew I made the right choice when my kid refused to come home with me in the evenings and wanted to continue playing there ! Neeta is always loving and affectionate with tke kids and I know my child will be cared for like he is at home. My older child is now in school but my younger one now goes to this daycare. There was no hesitation at all making the decision to send him here after the first one's experience. Though this is a home based daycare, it is a licensed facility and I am not apprehensive about any aspect of my child's safety or wellbeing. I am glad I chose this particular home based daycare over a bigger facility where my kid may have been lost in the crowd.

    I was very hesitant at first to leave my new 8 month old baby in the hands of strangers at a daycare, Love and Laughter playschool exceeded all my expectations. She is 2 years old now and she really enjoying going there. The best part i love there is activities. They do science projects, cooking projects, story time, Art and craft, painting, yoga, role plays etc. My daughter really enjoy it and do the same at home. She also love the food they serve. We are lucky to have you in our life and we will be always grateful and thankful for the your love.
